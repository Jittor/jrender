Then decompressed the Object and displacement maps .rar files. We renamed Map-COL.jpg to lambertian.jpg
We converted the displacement file from .tif to 16-bit .png. and saved it as bump.png
Then made a lowRes version of the bump map by rescaling it with sharpening in Photoshop using 
Autolevels to fill the dynamic range, converting 8-bit, and filling the seams with content aware fill.
We saved this as bump-lowRes.png.

Edited mtl file:
Set up texture maps and adjusted the default glossy highlight. 
We added:
map_bump -bm 0.001 bump-lowRes.png

map_bump -bm 0.02 bump.png (high res)
